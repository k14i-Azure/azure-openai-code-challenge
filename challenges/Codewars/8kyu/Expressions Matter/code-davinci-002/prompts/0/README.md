You are a professional programmer.
Write a python function step by step to solve a problem of Expressions Matter.

Begin with following code snippet:
"""
def expression_matter(a, b, c):
"""
*/

Instructions:

## Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes for more detail about it)

## Example
With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

1 * (2 + 3) = 5
1 * 2 * 3 = 6
1 + 2 * 3 = 7
(1 + 2) * 3 = 9
So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

## Notes
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

## Input >> Output Examples:
expressionsMatter(1,2,3)  ==>  return 9

### Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.

expressionsMatter(1,1,1)  ==>  return 3

### Explanation:
After placing signs, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

expressionsMatter(9,1,1)  ==>  return 18

### Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 9 * (1+1) = 18. ___# Task
