def loopover(mixed_up_board: List[List[str]], solved_board: List[List[str]]) -> Optional[List[str]]:
    # Returns the list of moves that will transform the mixedUpBoard grid to the solvedBoard grid.
    # Returns None if the configuration is unsolvable.
    # Each move is a 2 character long String like "R0" or "D2".
    # "R0" means move the 0th row right.
    # "D2" means move the 2nd column down.
